					<h2>TRAA Trout Hatchery</h2>
					<h3>Brown Trout Eggs Arriving Soon!</h3>
					<p>The TRAA trout hatchery is a popular activity of the TRAA as it's a great teaching tool with regard to the life cycle of a trout. Those involved with the hatchery get to see firsthand the development stages of the egg and the fry before their final release destinations to area streams.
					Volunteers attend to the operation every day to maintain the health and well-being of the trout. 
					There are ideally 2 members assigned for each day of the week. This is desirable as they can cover for each other and also allows us to match up anyone wanting to "learn the ropes" with an experienced mentor.

					<h2>TRAA Fishing Evening</h2>
					<h3>Cedar Cove (Killarney East) - Thursday, August 8, 2019; around 5:30pm</h3>
					<p>We've been heading out to try our luck every Thursday evening in July and this will continue through August. The next location will be at the section that flows by the new Cedar Cove neighbourhood.

					The start time is fluid as many people work but we shoot for 5:30pm. If you're delayed, just come when you're able. 

					Travelling north on Highbury Avenue, turn right on Killarney Road as soon as you cross the bridge spanning the North Thames River. Park along the road where you see the catchment ponds and the walking trail to the river.

					Wading is recommended but not necessary.

					Target species are smallmouth bass, rock bass and carp with chances at pike.

					These events are a go, rain or shine. Use you're own common sense. If the river is super high and muddy, your chances of catching a fish are slim so there's no need to endanger yourself. We clear off the river at the first sign of lightning, regardless of water conditions.

					<h2>TRAA Gear is now available!</h2>
					<h3>Tee shirts, hats and stickers.</h3>
					<p>Many of you have already ordered the TRAA tee shirts, but if you haven't you had better hurry because many sizes are almost sold out! These are a steal at $15 each.
					There are three different hat colours available: Clay Grey, Burnt Orange and Taupe. If you thought the tee's were a good deal, all three editions of these hats are also priced at $15 each.
					We now have some nice stickers featuring the TRAA logo that you can display on your vehicle, boat, lunchbox or wherever you like. These are $2 each but you get one for joining the TRAA as a member or renewing an existing TRAA membership.
